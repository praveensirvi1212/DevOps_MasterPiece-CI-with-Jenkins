# DevOps-MasterPiece

In this project, I created an end-to-end Production like CI-CD pipeline  while keeping in mind Securities Best Practices,DevSecOps principles and used all these tools *Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, JUnit, SonarQube, Jfrog Artifactory, Docker, Trivy, AWS S3, Docker Hub, GitHub CLI, EKS, ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, Slack and Hashicorp Vault,*  to achieve the goal.

#### I used Jenkins for Continuous Integration and ArgoCD for Continuous Deployment.

## Project Architecture
![](https://github.com/praveensirvi1212/DevOps_MasterPiece-CI-with-Jenkins/blob/main/images/pipeline.png)
## Pipeline flow:
1. When an event (commit) will occur in the application code GitHub repo,  the GitHub webhook will push the code to Jenkins and Jenkins will start the build.

2. Maven will build the code, if the build fails, the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user using Slack, If build success then

3.  Junit will do unit testing, if the application passes test cases then will go to the next step otherwise the whole pipeline will become a failure Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

4.  SonarQube scanner will scan the code and will send the report to the SonarQube server, where the report will go through the quality gate and gives the output to the web Dashboard.

 5. In the quality gate, we define conditions or rules like how many bugs or vulnerabilities, or code smells should be present in the code. 
                    Also, we have to create a webhook to send the status of quality gate status to Jenkins.
 If the quality gate status becomes a failure, the whole pipeline will become a failure then Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

5. After the quality gate passes, Artifacts will be sent to Jfrog Artifactory. If artifacts send to the artifactory successfully then will go to the next stage otherwise the whole pipeline will become a failure Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

6. After successful artifacts push to Artifactory, Docker will build the docker image.
if the docker build fails when the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

6. Trivy will scan the docker image, if it finds any Vulnerability then the whole pipeline will become a failure, and the generated report will be sent to s3 for future review and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

7. After the Trivy scan docker images will be pushed to the docker hub, if the docker fails to push docker images to the docker hub then the pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

8. After the docker push, Jenkins will clone the Kubernetes manifest repo from the feature branch, if the repo is already present then it will only pull the changes. If Jenkins is unable to clone the repo then the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

9. After Cloning the repo, Jenkins will update the image tag in the deployment manifest. If Jenkins is unable to update the image tag  then the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

10. After updating the image tag, Jenkins will commit the change and push the code to the feature branch. If Jenkins is unable to push the changes to the feature branch  then the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

11. After pushing changes to the feature branch, Jenkins will create a pull request against the main branch. If Jenkins is unable to create a pull request  then the whole pipeline will become a failure and Jenkins will notify the user that your build fails.

12. After the pull request creation, a senior person from the team will review and merge the pull request.

13. After merging the feature branch into the main branch, ArgoCD will pull the changes and deploy the application into Kubernetes.

Slack is a workplace communication tool, “a single place for messaging, tools and files.” .

Install Slack from the official website of Slack https://slack.com/intl/en-in/downloads/linux


### Stage-08: EKS Cluster Creation using Terraform 
To create EKS Cluster using Terraform, I have put the Terraform code here - https://github.com/praveensirvi1212/medicure-project/tree/master/eks_module

`Suggestion – create eks cluster after successful configuration of jenkins server. When jenkins is able to create pull request in the manifest repo.` 
#### Note: I have installed the terraform in the jenkins server and configured aws cli to create eks cluster. But you can use your local system to create eks cluster . for this, you have to install Terraform and aws cli on your local system.

Run this command after eks cluster creation to update or configure `.kube/config` file
```sh
aws eks --region your-region-name update-kubeconfig --name cluster-name
```


### Stage-09: Install ArgoCD in EKS 
I am assuming that you have already Kubernetes cluster running
1. use these commands to install argocd
```sh
kubectl create namespace argocd 
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
2. edit the argocd-server service to NodePort to access argocd ui

### Stage-10: Install helm ( on the system from where you are creating eks cluster)
1. use these commands to install the helm
```sh
curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install helm
```
### Stage-11: Install Prometheus and Grafana ( from where you have installed helm)

```sh
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm search repo prometheus-community
kubectl create namespace prometheus
helm install stable prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n prometheus
kubectl get pods -n prometheus
kubectl get svc -n prometheus
#in order to make Prometheus and grafana available outside the cluster, use LoadBalancer or NodePort instead of ClusterIP.
#Edit Prometheus Service
kubectl edit svc stable-kube-prometheus-sta-prometheus -n prometheus
#Edit Grafana Service
kubectl edit svc stable-grafana -n prometheus
kubectl get svc -n prometheus

#Access Grafana UI in the browser using load balancer or nodeport

  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = 1
}

api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
ui = true
```
```sh
sudo systemctl stop vault
sudo systemctl start vault
```

#### Commands to run to configure Vault and create AppRole

```sh 
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```
```sh 
vault operator init
```
* ` copy the unseal tokens and initial root token, save it somewhere for later use `
```sh

1. search for sh: shell script 
1. give your shell command and generate the pipeline syntax
1. paste it into stage >  steps > sh ‘ shell command’


```sh
stage ('Build & JUnit Test') {
	steps {
		sh 'mvn install' 
	}
	
}
```
### Stage-03 : SonarQube Analysis
In this stage, I used withSonarQubeEnv to  Prepare the SonarQube Scanner environment
and shell command sh
1. Define  a stage SonarQube Analysis
1. paste the command that we created at the time of the sonarqube project creation
```sh
stage('SonarQube Analysis'){
            steps{
                withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube-server') {
                        sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar \
                        -Dsonar.projectKey=gitops-with-argocd \
                        -Dsonar.projectName='gitops-with-argocd' \
                        -Dsonar.host.url=$sonarurl \
                        -Dsonar.login=$sonarlogin'''
                }
            }
        }

```

### Stage-04 : Quality gate
This step pauses Pipeline execution and waits for the previously submitted SonarQube analysis to be completed and returns quality gate status. Setting the parameter abortPipeline to true will abort the pipeline if the quality gate status is not green.
1. Define a stage as a Quality gate
1. go to this site https://opensource.triology.de/jenkins/pipeline-syntax/
1. search for  waitForQualityGate: Wait for SonarQube analysis to be completed and return quality gate status
1. generate pipeline syntax and paste it into steps
1. timeout is optional 
```sh
stage("Quality Gate") {
            steps {
              timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') {
                waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true
              }
            }
          }
```
### Stage-05 : Jfrog Artifactory
1. We wrap the steps in a script block to execute them as a Groovy script.
2. Inside the try block, we create a reference to the Artifactory server using the Artifactory.newServer method. You need to provide the URL of your Artifactory instance and the credentials ID configured in Jenkins.
3. We define an uploadSpec as a JSON string, specifying the pattern of files to upload and the target repository in Artifactory.
4. We call the server.upload(uploadSpec) method to upload the files to Artifactory based on the specified upload specification.
5. If any exception occurs during the upload process, the catch block will be executed, and an error message will be displayed.

```sh
steps {
                script {
                    try {
                        def server = Artifactory.newServer url: 'http://13.232.95.58:8082/artifactory', credentialsId: 'jfrog-cred'
                        def uploadSpec = """{
                            "files": [
                                {
                                    "pattern": "target/*.jar",
                                    "target": "${TARGET_REPO}/"
                                }
                            ]
                        }"""
                        
                        server.upload(uploadSpec)
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        error("Failed to deploy artifacts to Artifactory: ${e.message}")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```
### Stage-06 : Docker Build
First, write your dockerfile to build docker images. I have posted my dockerfile in  the application repo code
In this stage, I  used the shell command sh to build the docker image
1. Define  a stage Docker Build
1. go to this site https://opensource.triology.de/jenkins/pipeline-syntax/
1. search for sh: shell script 
1. give your shell command to build image > generate pipeline syntax
1. I used the build-id of jenkins and git commit id for versions of docker images

```sh
sstage('Docker  Build') {
            steps {
               
      	         sh 'docker build -t ${IMAGE_REPO}/${NAME}:${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT} .'
                
            }
        }
```
### Stage-07: Trivy Image scan
In this stage, I  trivy shell command sh to scan the docker image
1. Define  a stage Trivy Image scan
1. go to this site https://opensource.triology.de/jenkins/pipeline-syntax/
1. search for sh: shell script 
1.  give your Trivy shell command to scan the docker image
#### Note – There are 3 types of report output  formats of trivy ( Table, JSON, Template). I used  HTML template for the output report of the trivy scan
```sh
stage('Image Scan') {
            steps {
      	        sh ' trivy image --format template --template "@/usr/local/share/trivy/templates/html.tpl" -o report.html 		${IMAGE_REPO}/${NAME}:${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT} '
            }
        }
	}
}
```
### Stage-08: Upload report generated by trivy to AWS S3
In this stage, I used the shell command sh to Upload Scan report to AWS S3
1. Define  a stage Upload report to AWS S3
1. first create an AWS s3 bucket 
1. go to this site https://opensource.triology.de/jenkins/pipeline-syntax/
1. search for sh: shell script
1. give your shell command to upload the object to aws s3

```sh
stage('Upload Scan report to AWS S3') {
              steps {
                  
                //  sh 'aws configure set aws_access_key_id "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"  && aws configure set aws_secret_access_key "$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET"  && aws configure set region ap-south-1  && aws configure set output "json"' 
                  sh 'aws s3 cp report.html s3://devops-mastepiece/'
              }
        }
```

### Stage-09: Push Docker images to DockerHub
In this stage, I used   the shell command sh to push the docker image to the docker hub. I stored Credentials in Vault and accessed them in jenkins using  the Vault key. You can store DockerHub credentials in jenkins and use them as environment variables
1. Define  a stage Docker images push
1. go to this site https://opensource.triology.de/jenkins/pipeline-syntax/
1. search for sh: shell script
1. give your shell command to push docker images to the docker hub

 ``` sh
stage ('Docker Build') {
            steps {
                withVault(configuration: [skipSslVerification: true, timeout: 60, vaultCredentialId: 'vault-token', vaultUrl: 'http://13.232.53.209:8200'], vaultSecrets: [[path: 'secrets/creds/docker', secretValues: [[vaultKey: 'username'], [vaultKey: 'password']]]]) {
                    
                    sh "docker login -u ${username} -p ${password} "
                    sh 'docker push ${IMAGE_REPO}/${NAME}:${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT}'
		    	sh 'docker rmi  ${IMAGE_REPO}/${NAME}:${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT}'
                    
                    
                }
            }
        }
 ``` 
### Stage-10: Clone/Pull Repo (k8s manifest repo )
1. in this stage first we check whether the repo already exists or not
1. if exists then pull the changes
1. if not then will clone the repo

 ```sh
stage('Clone/Pull Repo') {
            steps {
                script {
                    if (fileExists('DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd')) {

                        echo 'Cloned repo already exists - Pulling latest changes'

                        dir("DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd") {
                          sh 'git pull'
                        }

                    } else {
                        echo 'Repo does not exists - Cloning the repo'
                        sh 'git clone -b feature https://github.com/praveensirvi1212/DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd.git'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```

### Stage: 11 Update Manifest
1. used sed command to replace images tag in deployment manifests
```sh
stage('Update Manifest') {
            steps {
                dir("DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd/yamls") {
                    sh 'sed -i "s#praveensirvi.*#${IMAGE_REPO}/${NAME}:${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT}#g" deployment.yaml'
                    sh 'cat deployment.yaml'
                }
            }
        }
```
### Stage: 12 Commit and Push Changes to the k8s manifest repo
1. set the global username
1. set the remote repo URL
1. checkout the branch to feature
1. stage the changes
1. commit the changes
1. push the changes to the feature branch
```sh
stage('Commit & Push') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'GITHUB_TOKEN', variable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN')]) {
                    dir("DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd/yamls") {
                        sh "git config --global user.email 'praveen@gmail.com'"
                        sh 'git remote set-url origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GIT_USER_NAME}/${GIT_REPO_NAME}'
                        sh 'git checkout feature'
                        sh 'git add deployment.yaml'
                        sh "git commit -am 'Updated image version for Build- ${VERSION}-${GIT_COMMIT}'"
                        sh 'git push origin feature'
                    }
                }    
            }
        }
```

### Stage: 13 Create Pull Request
`The reason to create a pull request is that argocd is sync automatically with Git Hub. GitHub is the only single source of truth for argocd. So if jenkins push the changes to the main branch then argocd will deploy changes directly without reviewing the changes. This should not happen in the Production environment. That’s why we create pull requests against the main branch. So a senior person from the team can review the changes and merge them into the main branch. Then n then only changes should go to the production environment.`

Here `token.txt` contain the GitHub token, the reason for storing the GitHub token in the text file bcoz `gh auth login --with-token` accept only STDIN Input 
 
```sh
stage('Raise PR') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'GITHUB_TOKEN', variable: 'GITHUB_TOKEN')]) {
                    dir("DevOps_MasterPiece-CD-with-argocd/yamls") {
                        sh '''
                            set +u
                            unset GITHUB_TOKEN
                            gh auth login --with-token < token.txt
                            
                        '''
                        sh 'git branch'
                        sh 'git checkout feature'
                        sh "gh pr create -t 'image tag updated' -b 'check and merge it'"
                    }
                }    
            }
        } 
```



### Stage: 14 Post build action 
In post build action I used Slack notification. After  the build jenkins will send a notification message to Slack whether your build success or failure.
1. go to jenkins > your project > pipeline syntax > search for slacksend: send slack message 
1. write your channel name and message > generate pipeline syntax.
#### Note – I used custom messages for my project. I created a function for Slack notification and called the function into Post build.
 ```sh
post{
	always{
		sendSlackNotifcation()
	}
}
```
sendSlackNotification function 
 ```sh
def sendSlackNotifcation()
{
    if ( currentBuild.currentResult == "SUCCESS" ) {
        buildSummary = "Job_name: ${env.JOB_NAME}\n Build_id: ${env.BUILD_ID} \n Status: *SUCCESS*\n Build_url: ${BUILD_URL}\n Job_url: ${JOB_URL} \n"
        slackSend( channel: "#devops", token: 'slack-token', color: 'good', message: "${buildSummary}")
    }
    else {
        buildSummary = "Job_name: ${env.JOB_NAME}\n Build_id: ${env.BUILD_ID} \n Status: *FAILURE*\n Build_url: ${BUILD_URL}\n Job_url: ${JOB_URL}\n  \n "
        slackSend( channel: "#devops", token: 'slack-token', color : "danger", message: "${buildSummary}")
    }
}

 ```

### Quality Gate Status in Jenkins
 SonarQube Quality gate status is green and passed.   
You can apply your custom quality gate like there should be zero ( bug, Vulnerability, code smell ) and if your code has greater than 0 (bugs, vulnerability, code smells). Then your quality gate status will become a failure or red. If your quality gate status becomes a failure, stages after the quality gate will be a failure.
